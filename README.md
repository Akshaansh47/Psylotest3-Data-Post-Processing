# Psylotest3-Data-Post-Processing

**Overview**

This code provides for the easy extraction and analysis of data from Psylotest3 results, useful in structural analysis and quick testing.

**About**

The Psylotech load cell is a very versatile and accurate piece of machinery that can perform nearly all types of tensile and compressive tests, with customizable grips and settings. The limit is 10kN which is more than sufficient for most laboratory tests involving PLA materials.

**Requirements**

Just your filename.

**Functionality**

The user of this code can view any of the following data:
1. Plot of Primary Encoder Displacement vs. Time
2. Plot of Axial Loading vs. Time
3. Plot of Axial Loading vs. Primary Encoder Displacement (indicative of Stress-Strain for homogeneous materials)
4. Values of maximum axial load, maximum primary encoder displacement

This significantly reduces the time needed to obtain these plots, especially while doing bulk experimentation.
